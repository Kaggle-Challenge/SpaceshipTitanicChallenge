# 🚀 Spaceship Titanic – A Kaggle Adventure

This is our take on the [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic) Kaggle competition — a fun, sci-fi-themed machine learning challenge.

## 🌌 Overview

The mission is to predict which passengers got mysteriously "transported" to another dimension after a cosmic accident. This project serves as a comprehensive exploration of the Spaceship Titanic dataset, demonstrating a complete machine learning workflow from data understanding to model deployment.

## 📊 What's This Project About?

In this project, we delved deep into the dataset, performing thorough cleaning and transformation. We engineered insightful features to capture underlying patterns and built robust predictive models utilizing the powerful capabilities of **XGBoost** and **LightGBM**.

You'll find code for:

  * 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing distributions, correlations, and key relationships to understand the data.
  * 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Missing Value Handling:** Implementing smart heuristics and techniques to address incomplete data.
  * 🏗️ **Feature Engineering:** Creating new, informative features from existing ones (e.g., decoding cabin information, calculating total spending).
  * 🤖 **Model Training & Evaluation:** Developing and fine-tuning predictive models, assessing their performance rigorously.
  * 📁 **Generating a Kaggle Submission:** Preparing predictions in the required format for submission to the competition.

## 🛠️ What We Did: A Detailed Rundown

Here’s a quick rundown of what’s going on inside the notebook and associated scripts:

  * **Exploration:**

      * Visualized distributions of key features (e.g., Age, Spending categories).
      * Analyzed correlations between features and the 'Transported' target variable.
      * Investigated passenger demographics and their likelihood of being transported.

  * **Cleaning:**

      * Filled missing numerical values (e.g., 'Age', 'RoomService', 'FoodCourt', 'ShoppingMall', 'Spa', 'VRDeck') using appropriate imputation strategies (e.g., median, mean, or predictive models).
      * Handled missing categorical values using mode imputation or by creating a "Missing" category.

  * **Feature Engineering:**

      * **Cabin Decoding:** Broke down the 'Cabin' column (e.g., "A/5/S") into three distinct features: 'Deck' (A), 'Cabin\_Number' (5), and 'Side' (S - Port/Starboard).
      * **Total Expenses:** Created a 'TotalExpenses' feature by summing up 'RoomService', 'FoodCourt', 'ShoppingMall', 'Spa', and 'VRDeck' to represent overall passenger spending.

  * **Modeling:**

      * **Model Selection:** Explored various classification algorithms, with a focus on **XGBoostClassifier** and **LightGBMClassifier**.
      * **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Systematically tuned hyperparameters for the selected models using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize performance.
      * **Cross-Validation:** Employed k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust model evaluation and prevent overfitting.
      * **Prediction & Submission:** Generated predictions on the test set and formatted them for Kaggle submission.

## ⚙️ Main Components: Deeper Dive

  * `notebooks/Spaceship_Titanic_EDA_and_Modeling.ipynb`: This Colab notebook is the heart of the project, containing the full workflow from data loading and EDA to feature engineering, model training, and prediction generation. It's designed for interactive exploration and development.
  * `train.csv`: Contains training data.
  * `test.csv`: Contains testing data.
  * `submission/`: Stores the final `submission.csv` file, ready to be uploaded to the Kaggle competition.
  * `models/`: (Not explicitly listed in your `Files Included` but inferred from `Main Components`) This directory would typically store trained models (e.g., using `joblib` or `pickle`) for future use or deployment without retraining.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

This project primarily leverages the following Python libraries:

  * **Data Manipulation:** `pandas`, `numpy`
  * **Data Visualization:** `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
  * **Machine Learning:** `scikit-learn` (for preprocessing, model selection, evaluation metrics), `xgboost`, `lightgbm`
  * **Notebook Environment:** `Google Colab`

## 📈 My Best Results (So Far):

Our best efforts have yielded the following performance:

  * ✅ **Accuracy on validation:** *92%*
  * 🏅 **Kaggle public leaderboard score:** *[Please insert your best Kaggle public leaderboard score here, e.g., 0.80126]*
